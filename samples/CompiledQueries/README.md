# Explicitly Compiled Queries

This sample demonstrates Explicitly Compiled Queries.  The program runs a benchmark test that measures throughput (queries/second) of regular auto-compiled queries compared to an explicitly compiled query.

This sample depends on the Adventure Works 2014 sample database, which may be downloaded [here](https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550).
